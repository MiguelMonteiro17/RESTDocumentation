# REST Documentation
This project idea comes from the need in my workplace to centralize all REST documentation in order to expose and consult more easily. This was the solution i was proposing but the team opted for other solution.

Anyway i decided to do this project in my free time to try out new things.

## Version 1
The first version will consist of Spring Boot Rest API that uses MongoDB (never used NOSQL, so i think it's a good time to try it out).

## Version 2
For version 2 i will implement the CQRS pattern and try message queuing Apache Kafka.
